If you are a rando reading this, there will probably be spoilers below, so play the game first. When it's done anyway.

# Systems

* Stats
  * We should probably get a flavorful list of stats that lead towards our various endings
  * Possible Personal Stats:
    * Age
    * Height
    * Weight
    * Birthday/Sign
  * Possible Stats to Check against:
    * Con
    * Str
    * Int
    * Charisma
    * Morality
    * Stress
    * Renown
    * Trust
  * Hidden meters
    * Business
    * Combat Ability
    * Research
    * Cooking
    * Robotics
* Stat Changes
  * Stat increases have a minimum increase amount and a critical increase amount
  * By default, you have a 10% chance of a critical increase
  * The same applies to stat decreases if we choose to have those
* Calendar
  * The game plays out on a monthly cycle
  * Actions are taken by the player on the 1st of each month, these include:
    * Scheduling Daily Events for the upcoming month
    * Making Lifestyle Choices which will continue to apply until changed
* Events
  * Daily Events are put onto the calendar by the player on the 1st of the month
    * Daily Events can cause Stat Changes
  * Special Events are put onto the calendar by the game
    * Special Events can ask you to choose an answer to a multiple-question
* Lifestyle Choices
  * Lifestyle Choices can buff the critical rate for a given stat
  * These should probably have some kind of cost???
