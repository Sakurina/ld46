If you are a rando reading this, there will probably be spoilers below, so play the game first. When it's done anyway.

# Systems

* Stats
  * We should probably get a flavorful list of stats that lead towards our various endings
  * Possible Personal Stats:
    * Age
    * Height
    * Weight
    * Birthday/Sign
  * Possible Stats to Check against:
    * Con
    * Str
    * Int
    * Charisma
    * Morality
    * Stress
    * Renown
    * Trust
  * Hidden meters
    * Business
    * Combat Ability
    * Research
    * Cooking
    * Robotics
* Stat Changes
  * Stat increases have a minimum increase amount and a critical increase amount
  * By default, you have a 10% chance of a critical increase
  * The same applies to stat decreases if we choose to have those
* Calendar
  * The game plays out on a monthly cycle
  * Actions are taken by the player on the 1st of each month, these include:
    * Scheduling Daily Events for the upcoming month
    * Making Lifestyle Choices which will continue to apply until changed
* Events
  * Daily Events are put onto the calendar by the player on the 1st of the month
    * Daily Events can cause Stat Changes
  * Special Events are put onto the calendar by the game
    * Special Events can ask you to choose an answer to a multiple-question
* Lifestyle Choices
  * Lifestyle Choices can buff the critical rate for a given stat
  * These should probably have some kind of cost???

# UIs

* Title Screen
* ???
* Main Screen
  * Only available during the 1st of the month:
    * Schedule Popup: Lets you pick what actions you want on what weeks

# Scenario

* **World Background**
  * Future Sci-fi
  * Society has become increasingly mechanical with the advancement of technology--public displays of emotion are frowned upon and the populace passes one another like ghosts. Designs are centered around striving for "perfection".
* **MC Background**
  * Head of R&D for A.I. in government funded labratory. To date, research has been stagnant due to missing "element" which MC cannot fully grasp.
  * MC has no currently living family or close contacts.
* **Common Route Scenario**
  * One day, the MC receives an ominous and threatening e-mail alerting him to compulsory participation in the Advanced Civilization Pruning Program. The ACPP is explained to be a 6 year time-boxed program given to planets at the cusp of technological revolution that would advance them to the next step of civilization. Through the ACPP, the "Girlish Insight and Valuation for Extermination Reconnaissance" or "GIVER" unit is sent to the planet's chosen "Caretaker" or "TAKER" who must then raise the unit for the 6 year period. The program is then used as a litmus test to assess the capabilities of the host planet--those that fail suffer complete and total annhilation from the overseeing body of Alien Civilizations.
* **True Route Revelations**
  * Girl is not actually an alien--she had been writing the emails to the MC herself the entire time. Can hint at this throughout the scenarios in subtle ways to make this not obvious.
  * Subvert other route endings which actually do show aliens being real (to distinguish what's true and isn't)
  * Need to tie girl to MC--maybe in opening sequence, MC finds and abandoned robotics unit that he takes home to dispose of properly which the girl sees. That is, MC is caught up in society's leanings towards emotionless interaction but still shows lapses of empathy/kindness
  * Girl needs impetus for not being like the rest of society, maybe sheltered royalty from a recent event/war that had disappeared--secret princess mode. Royal education could help explain intelligence for writing emails well. This would need to be hinted at in extremely subtle way since anything in your face would be way too predictable.
* **Themes / Motifs**
  * Juxtaposition of caretaker vs. caregiver.
    * Interesting re:  direction of things. He is the taker but gives care. She is the giver but takes what she receives. Ultimately in relation to the overarching theme, their denominations are actually accurate: girl gives MC means to learn emotion again.
  * Alien unit being more human than the humans
  * Perfection vs. imperfection
    * Imperfection makes humans human
  * Food
  * I need wacky alien comic relief
