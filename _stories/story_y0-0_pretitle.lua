		,"With the help of the Advanced A.I. technology and robotics I developed, mankind found itself marching towards a new age of efficiency-"
		,"But with that came an unforeseen consequence."
		,"Technology laid bare humanity's insecurities, breaking the once common bonds of society."
		,"My robotics became tools that only seemed to exacerbate the insatiable hunger of man."
		,"Work and efficiency were the only things that mattered now."

		,"7 years since the government underwent complete reconstruction."
		,"The people thought my technology would be enough to replace them."

		,"You see it often. Once a unit has outgrown its usefulness, it gets tossed aside to rust away with the rest of the junk."
		,"But maybe this unit has seen something. Maybe it's learned something."
		,"Maybe buried within its memory unit lies something that will help me find \"it\"."
		,"I delicately straighten its unkempt hair and toss it over my shoulder to take back to my home."
		,"Maybe I'll learn something from you."
